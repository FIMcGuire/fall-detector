# fall-detector
-co-developed with Scott Murphy-

A device that detects falls and alerts a companion Android application

Unfortunately, only Arduino code exists, as the original Android code has been lost and was never uploaded for marking during my course.

Appologies also for the voice over on the video, I was told to make the video under 5 minutes long and had too much to show and tell to comfortably fit within that time limit, so I had to speak quite fast.
